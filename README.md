# Android_Pets

This project will let you practice creating a new project including creating a git repo for it, adding it to GitHub on your account, making changes, committing them, and pushing them.

## Instructions

### Part 1 - Create Android Studio Project

1. Create a new Android Studio project called "Pets".
2. It should display a linear layout with a list of your current and past pets. (If you've never had pets, you can instead list your favorite animals.)
3. Build the project using a `LinearLayout` embedded in a `ScrollView` if the list is long enough.

### Part 2 - Create a git Repository

1. Using Terminal, `cd` to the directory containing your Android Studio project.
2. Initialize a new git repo using `git init`.
3. Add all the files in the directory to the repo using `git add.`.
4. Commit the files using `git commit -m "notes"`.

### Part 3 - Create a new Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and create a new repository called Pets. Do not initialize the repo with a README or .gitignore file.
2. Follow the instructions shown on GitHub to add the GitHub repo as a remote origin to the repository on your computer.
3. Push your Android Studio project to GitHub.

### Part 4 - Commit Changes

1. Modify your project by adding a list of animals you'd like to have as pets (be as fanciful as you want).
2. Add the modified file(s) to the git staging area.
3. Commit the modified files.
4. Push your changes to GitHub.

### Part 5 - Verify

1. Clone the repo from GitHub to a new folder on your computer (e.g. your Desktop)
2. Open the newly-cloned repository's Android Studio project.
3. Build and run, making sure it works and shows _all_ the pets you added, including those you added in Part 4.

## Submit

Submit your project to your PM by sending them a link to your repository on GitHub via Slack DM (Direct Message).
